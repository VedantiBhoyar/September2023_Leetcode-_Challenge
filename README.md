## About the Challenge

The LeetCode September Challenge is a month-long coding competition featuring a new problem every day. This repository contains my solutions to these challenges. By participating in this event, I aim to enhance my problem-solving skills and explore various algorithms and data structures.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`Day-X/`**: Each day's solutions are stored in separate directories, where X is the day of the month.

## Solutions

Here's a list of the problems I've tackled during the challenge:

- [Day 1: Counting Bits](Day1/): Topic: Bit Manipulation .
- [Day 2: Extra Characters in a String](Day2/): Topic: Dynamic Programming/Tries .
- [Day 3: Unique Paths](Day3/): Topic: Dynamic Programming.
- [Day 4: Linked List Cycle ](Day4/): Topic: LinkedList (Floyd Cycle).
- [Day 5: Copy List with Random Pointer ](Day5/): Topic: LinkedList
- [Day 6:  Split Linked List in Parts ](Day6/): Topic: LinkedList
- [Day 7:  Reverse Linked List II](Day7/): Topic: LinkedList
