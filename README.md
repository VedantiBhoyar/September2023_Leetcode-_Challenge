## About the Challenge

The LeetCode September Challenge is a month-long coding competition featuring a new problem every day. This repository contains my solutions to these challenges. By participating in this event, I aim to enhance my problem-solving skills and explore various algorithms and data structures.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`Day-X/`**: Each day's solutions are stored in separate directories, where X is the day of the month.

## Solutions

Here's a list of the problems I've tackled during the challenge:

- [Day 1: Problem Name](Day-1/): A brief description of the problem and my solution.
- [Day 2: Problem Name](Day-2/): A brief description of the problem and my solution.
- ...

Each solution includes detailed explanations, code snippets, and any necessary setup instructions.

## How to Run

To run the solutions, navigate to the specific day's directory and follow the provided instructions. You may need to have a specific programming language or framework installed, so make sure to check the prerequisites.

## Contributing

Contributions are encouraged! If you have better solutions or suggestions for improving existing solutions, please feel free to open a pull request. Together, we can create an even better resource for the LeetCode community.
