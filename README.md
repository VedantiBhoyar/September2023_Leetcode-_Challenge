## About the Challenge

The LeetCode September Challenge is a month-long coding competition featuring a new problem every day. This repository contains my solutions to these challenges. By participating in this event, I aim to enhance my problem-solving skills and explore various algorithms and data structures.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`Day-X/`**: Each day's solutions are stored in separate directories, where X is the day of the month.

## Solutions
